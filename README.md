## venv
This application was developed with a virtual environment. Be sure to use the virtual environment by using the following command.
`source venv/bin/activate`

If venv is not available on the project, you can initialize using the following command
`python3 -m venv venv`

When the virtual environment is activated, you should see "(venv)" at the beginning of your terminal prompt.
